Note: this repository hosts the web interface for Picocrypt in a server-like style for optimal performance and size, so there are multiple files to be loaded by the browser (you can't save an offline copy into a single file). If you're looking for a single page downloadable web interface, the older https://github.com/Picocrypt/Web contains the code and instructions for that. Or, you can just clone this repository and serve it as a static site yourself with something as simple as:
```
python -m http.server
```
